					<p>At a young age Keanu did believe the fame was great, for a bit. Nowadays he's not into it with the drawback of no more privacy settling in. He's had issues of being stalked and houses being broken into. He usually tries to stay out of the paparazzi and limelight. These days, he's well known for the involuntary pop culture memes.
