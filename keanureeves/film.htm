					<p>Keanu got his first break in a supporting role in the Canadian film Youngblood (1986). He dropped out of school and went straight to Hollywood in hopes for landing bigger roles. Shortly after, he was popping in notable films like River's Edge (1986) and Dangerour Liasons (1988). He finally hit his first real break in the totally radical Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure (1989). 
					</p>
					
					<p>In the oncoming years he has performed in many notable roles. My Own Private Idaho (1991), Point Break (1991), Speed (1994), and the Devil's 
					Advocate (1997), just to name a few. The year is 1999, the Matrix is

					released and Keanu hits his most iconic film of all time. An apocalyptic
					future where machines have taken over and reality is a virtual world called the Matrix, until you are "saved" and unplugged. After the Matrix trilogy he acted in mainstream and indie films. Aside from acting he also produced, 
					
					<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2014338/">Side by Side (2012),</a>
					
					 and even directed, 
					
					<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2016940/">Man of Tai Chi (2013).</a> 
					
					Although many great films have released since the Matrix, none were as iconic as the Matrix until 2014 and John Wick is released. He plays the role of a retired hitman who leaves the simple life to hunt the gangsters who killed his dog. With the sequel John Wick: Chapter 2 adding to the storyline and filling in more backstory, we now wait for the third film, John Wick: Parabellum, expected to be released in 2019.
