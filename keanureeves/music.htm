					<p>Keanu struggled with dyslexia, which is a reason why he never received his high school diploma. He enjoyed two things: hockey and theatre. He ended up dropping out of high school to move to Los Angeles, California to pursue an acting career. Being new in town, he was trying to make friends. While shopping at his local supermarket he sees a man wearing a 
					
					<a href="https://www.nhl.com/redwings">Detroit Red Wings</a>

					t-shirt. Keanu asked the man if he played hockey and how he'd like to join him in a pick up game. Little did he know that man was fellow actor 
					
					<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0537567/">Robert Mailhouse,</a>
					
					
					who would then become his bandmate in the band called Dogstar. 
					</p>
					
					<p>Dogstar started their days in the garage like every other sloppy grunge-punk sounding band. Their first show was at bar in LA where Weezer opened for them. With Keanu's fame growing, due to acting, so did Dogstar. They toured with Bon Jovi to Australia and New Zealand. They later opened for David Bowie and played on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Several tours later, the band came to an end with each member wanting different things. They ended on good terms and are still good friends.
