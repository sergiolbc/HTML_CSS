			<p>I am currently a student in progress for a degree of Associates in  Applied Science: Web Development and Graphic Design at Estrella Mountain  Community College. I plan to earn my degree by May 2019. I am hopeful to  continue my education through a transfer to an accredited university and fulfill my  goal of completing a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in the same field.</p>
			
			<p>My progress through academics has given me  experience in both the back-end and front-end process of software development.  This includes, but is not limited to, skills in coding Java, JavaScript and PHP;  mastery of graphic design with Adobe: Illustrator, Animator, and Photoshop; and  expertise in web development architecture with a core understanding of  cross-browser  compatibility, general web function standards, and security best practices.  I have an understanding of MySQL, networking, and various operating systems; I  have worked with both Linux and Windows.</p>
			
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>Excellent written and verbal communications skills</li>
					<li>Bilingual in English and Spanish</li>
					<li>Proficient with Microsoft Office, Word, Power Point, and Excel</li>
					<li>Responsible, enthusiastic and attentive to detail</li>
				</ul>
