				<p>Slytherin House is one of the four houses into which students are Sorted when they start their first year at Hogwarts. Slytherin House was founded by <a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Salazar_Slytherin">Salazar Slytherin</a> around 990AD. His personal belief in the superiority of Pure Blood wizards still influences the attitudes of Slytherin members today.</p>
				
				<p>Slytherin corresponds roughly with the element of water due to serpents being commonly associated with the sea and lochs in western European mythology, as well as serpents being physically fluid and flexible animals. Similarly, in <a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Celts">Celtic</a> mythology, water is seen as a portal to another world, leading some to speculate that the element was chosen to symbolise many Slytherins' hope for a pure-blood only community. The colours also correspond with waters around lakes and lochs often being green, and silver being often associated with grey rain water.</p>

				<p class="quote">"Always knew Salazar Slytherin was a twisted old loony, but I never knew he started all this pure-blood stuff. I wouldn't be in his house if you paid me. Honestly, if the Sorting Hat had tried to put me in Slytherin, I'd've got the train straight back home." <br>

			  <p>Slytherins tend to be ambitious, shrewd, cunning, strong leaders, and achievement-oriented. They also have highly developed senses of self-preservation. This means that Slytherins tend to hesitate before acting, so as to weigh all possible outcomes before deciding exactly what should be done.They tend to take charge and possess strong leadership skills. Slytherins are often self-assured and confident of their own competence and can be very loyal. Another characteristic some Slytherins share is a tendency towards deep, unrequited love.</p>
				
			  <p>The Slytherin common room is a low-ceilinged, dungeon-like room with greenish lamps and chairs, with skulls all around. It is located under the lake, and has tapestries decorated with scenes from the lives of famous Slytherins. According to the Slytherin House Introduction Letter, the beds in the dormitories are four-posters with green silk hangings and covers embroidered with silver threads. You can hear the soothing sound of the lake lapping against the windows at night.</p>
