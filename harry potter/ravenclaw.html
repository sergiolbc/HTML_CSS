				<p>Ravenclaw House is one of the four houses at Hogwart into which the students are Sorted when they start their first year. Ravenclaw is the Hogwarts house of founder <a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Rowena_Ravenclaw">Rowena Ravenclaw</a>. The House places high value on intelligence, wit, and learning. </p>
				
			  <p>Ravenclaw Tower, which is located on the west side of the castle; the entrance is a door at the top of a tightly winding spiral staircase that leads up from the fifth floor. The door has neither handle nor keyhole, but a talking bronze knocker in the shape of an eagle. Rather than asking for a conventional password, the knocker will ask a question; if answered correctly, the knocker will compliment the person on the answer and the door will swing open.</p>
				
			  <p>The common room, like the other House common rooms, is decorated in House colours (blue and bronze silk wall hangings, in this case, and a midnight-blue carpet decorated with stars). The room is wide, circular, and very airy, with a domed ceiling painted with stars, and walls with graceful arched windows that provide a spectacular view of the surrounding mountains. There are 		bookcases, tables, and chairs, and opposite the entrance is another door leading to the dormitories. Beside this door is a plinth on which stands a life-size statue in white marble of Rowena Ravenclaw wearing her <a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Ravenclaw%27s_Diadem">diadem.</a></p>

			  <p>Ravenclaws tend to be curious about the world and pay attention to the world around them. Ravenclaws are known to be logical and rational. Often hard-working and diligent, as often is the case with intellectuals with a predisposition for academics, some of the pupils sorted under the blue-bronzed eagle are known to be inclined to dismiss certain social expectation for the sake of satisfying their own intellectual curiosity. Some of these eventually also ended up being not only accepted, but even celebrated, in spite of being initially subjected to scorn for their various oddities. </p>
			  <p>Within the house, though, theyâ€™re well-known for being welcoming and encouraging of creativity, eccentricity and individuality and being very accepting. Although&nbsp;Ravenclaws are so competitive when it comes to academic success that they are known to back stab each other, and likely other students, in order to get top marks.</p>
