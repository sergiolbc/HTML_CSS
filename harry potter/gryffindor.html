				<p>Gryffindor House is one of the four houses at Hogwart into which the students are Sorted when they start their first year. Gryffindor is the Hogwarts house of founder <a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Godric_Gryffindor">Godric Gryffindor</a>. Gryffindor House places high value on traits such as courage, chivalry, and nerve.</p>
				
			  <p>The entrance to the Gryffindor common room (which, in turn, lead to the Gryffindor dormitories) is located behind a large painting of a Fat Lady in a pink silk dress. If you know the right password to tell her, she swings open to reveal a round opening in the wall. The common room contains a lot of squashy armchairs, a fireplace, and tables. The fireplace is connected to the <a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Floo_Network">Floo Network</a>, but as it is extremely public except in the dead of night, Gryffindors usually use owls to communicate with their families instead. There's also a notice board, for public announcements such as the date of the next Hogsmeade weekend, but also for notices from individual students seeking to buy or sell secondhand books, or trade Chocolate Frog cards, or similar, as in any school.</p>

				<p>There are two staircases opening off the common room into the Tower itself: the boys' staircase, on which the seven boys' dormitories are located (one for each year) and the girls' staircase, on which the seven girls' dormitories are located (one for each year). The girls' staircase is under a spell so that if a boy sets foot on it and persists for a few steps, a wailing klaxon goes off and the staircase	temporarily Transfigures itself into a stone slide, sending him and anyone else on the stairs sailing to the bottom. According to Hogwarts: A History, the founders believed that girls were more trustworthy than boys, so that while the girls' staircase is enchanted to prevent boys from getting in, the boys' staircase does not carry a reciprocal enchantment. Each dormitory is a round room with windows looking out onto the grounds, and containing four-poster beds. The common room is very comfortable, and members of the Gryffindor house meet there for study groups, celebrations, or relaxation. The walls are lined with portraits, each one depicting a previous or current Head of Gryffindor.</p>
				
				<p>The Gryffindor team won the <a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Inter-House_Quidditch_Cup">Quidditch Cup</a> during the 1993 - 1994 season - the first time since 1984 - and again during the 1995 - 1996 season. They wear robes of scarlet.</p>
